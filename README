The twitter wall project is based on twitter-oauih [1], cinematic experience demo [2], and Qt5 launch
demo [3]. The Webkit3 (used in qt5) doesn't provide the javascript api at the moment. The authentication
phase was moved into 3rd party web browser.

The taken parts of project could have different licence.
